# lamAPI-benchmarking

LamAPI simplifies access to Wikidata with an easy-to-use interface. It
allows users to search through Wikidata using full-text search and
provides detailed analysis of entities through different services:
 - lookup
 - objects
 - literals
The project will be focusing on implementing the State of the Art for the Entity Recognition
and defining an algorithm to improve the disambiguation process.

The contributions will be the following:
 - implementation of state of the art clustering
 - propose a method based on NER types that improves the candidates retrieval
 - find out how the NER types can be useful during the disambiguation process 
 - build a dashboard in order to interact with the results from the clustering
 - track the carbon footprint of the pipeline
